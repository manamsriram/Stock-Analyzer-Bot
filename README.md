# Stock Analyzer ðŸ“ˆ
An AI Bot that can help you with stock investment by analyzing all the real-time as well as historic stock-related information with the help of LLM

# Motivation

As a retail investor, if you don't have a finance background or the capability to understand all the complicated financial terms, makes the stock analysis process really time-consuming. Every time I end up watching some fin-YouTuber's video or some random blog on the internet to avoid manually dealing with all this stuff. This is where i thought of making a Langchian and LLM-based bot that can take real-time as well as historic data to make investment analysis 
<!--
# How to run 
All the code and experimentation can be found in <code>stock_analyzer_bot.ipynb</code> notebook. 
You need to add openai_api_key in the initial code cell

# Experimentation
Have defined a couple of tools/functions for the agent which scraps and gather real time information related to the input stock. It includes following- 
1. Historic Stock price data. (You can take 1month, 1 year data depending on you models context length)
2. Company's financial statement  
3. Latest company related news  
All these factors seems sufficient for the analysis, it captures historical performance as well as real time market sentiment. If you want further more tools can be added. 

#### Approach - Predefine prompt with function calls
- Open ai has function calls, which is really helpful with which we can get structured output as we want in json format from LLM 
- In this method stock ticker is extracted with the help of function calls. As most of the future code was dependet on this single argument
- And in the later stages stock data, news, financial statements are simply fetched by inputing ticker symbol. Further analyzed by openai llm

 # Further improvements and addition to be done
a) More tools can be added. For eg. math tool to perform complex technical analysis \
b) Support of other opensource LLMS
